Branch zzz-cmdpage
("zzz" to move it to the bottom of the list)
PoC for using a regular page instead of the command popup-box

PRO:
* everything is a page

CON:
* navigation becomes a hassle. that needs to be additionally improved.
* going back to a previous page is always a page navigation (instead of hide)
  that means most pages will do a full refresh
  which takes a way much of the improvements

VERDICT:
Keep until there is an actual request for it
